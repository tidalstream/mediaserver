List of blacklisted projects
================================

As you create software, you come across projects that might solve your problem but for some reason cannot be used.
This is my list of those.

Scraping a publicly accessible website is not a crime no matter you intended purpose. That's why this project only uses website scrapers or APIs that allow commercial usage. I believe that no matter what their ToS say it's legal to scrape all I want, see: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/09/victory-ruling-hiq-v-linkedin-protects-scraping-public-data

Another important part for me is to not add any GPL or other restrictively licensed software.
